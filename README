volinfoman
----------

This is a volunteer information manager, originally developed for a
non-profit in Austin, TX.  It will track volunteer contact information
and volunteer hours, optionally allowing those things to be modified
by the volunteer instead of forcing the volunteer coordinator to do it.

The project is coded in Java for the Google App Engine and Google Web
Toolkit platforms.
